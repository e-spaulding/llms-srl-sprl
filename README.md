# SRL and SPRL prompting experiments

## Data prep

Navigate to the `data-prep` directory and follow the instructions; download the necessary data, set the necessary env variables, and run the preprocessing script `data-prep/preprocess-data.sh`.

## Experiments

Install the required packages in `requirements.txt` (especially if you are preprocessing the data). Find instructions to run the GPT experiments in `scripts/gpt`, and the smaller LM experiments in `scripts/hf`.
